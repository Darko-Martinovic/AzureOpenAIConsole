Sacré-Cœur is a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica, dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Paris, France. A popular landmark, it is located at the summit of the butte Montmartre, the highest point in the city. Construction began in 1875 and was finished in 1914, though it was not consecrated until after the end of World War I in 1919. The basilica was designed by Paul Abadie in a Romano-Byzantine style and is one of the most recognizable landmarks in Paris.
